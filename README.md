MuVihand is a synthetic 3D hand pose dataset that is created with the help of [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/), a free web-based service for 3D animations and characters, several images as backgrounds from [Pxfuel](https://www.pxfuel.com/) website, and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a 3D computer graphics software for creating the data. The data have been recorded from 10 distinct subjects with 12 cameras, where 6 cameras capture the whole body and the other 6 cameras track a specific hand. The dataset provides the 2D and 3D locations for 21 hand keypoints.
